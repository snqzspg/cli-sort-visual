# Command Line sorting visualizer
Sort for fun, sort of fun

> This project is on its first days on GitHub. It may take some time to create this page.

## A short description...
When started the applications presents an array of numbers. Each integer is represented as a vertical bar to a certain height; larger numbers produces taller heights.

At the beginning, the numbers will be shuffled using a user-chosen hardcoded shuffling method. This will cause the "bars" to be out of order.

Then the sorting algorithm will be started to sort the "bars" into their respective places.

The number of comparisons and writes will be kept tracked of during the sorting process.

## Building (or "Installing")
Currently there are no binaries available to download, so you may have to do some code compiling yourself.
### Prerequisites
This project is designed to be compiled using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). 
#### Windows
For windows, it is recommended to use [MinGW64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (a fork of the original MinGW, standing for Minimalist GNU for Windows) to compile the code.

*The rest is to be written...*
